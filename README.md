### Hi there, I'm Guillermo

🙇‍♂️ A software engineer with over three years of experience in non-profit organizations and project management. At the moment I'm also a data science student at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)** nearing graduation.

💙 Some things I like: agile, design thinking, data cleaning and wrangling, progressive web apps, data architecture design, cloud computing, headless content management, native and edible forestry, surfing, traveling, and yoga.

🏡 Currently serving as a data engineer for Family Promise of Spoke in an effort to prevent homelessness in Washington state.
