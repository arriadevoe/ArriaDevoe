### Hi there 👋

I'm Guillermo, a software engineer with over three years of non-profit and mixed project management experience. At the moment I'm a data science student at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)** nearing graduation while working on side projects. 

I'm passionate about: progressive web apps, data engineering, headless content management systems, daily learning, regenerative building design, strength training, and yoga.

Currently working on a secure API to connect private and non-profit organizations to help reduce homelessness in Washington state.
