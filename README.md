# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guillermo, a software developer with a strong background in environmental restoration and non-profits. At the moment I'm a data science student at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)** nearing graduation while working on side projects. I'm also passionate about daily learning, progressive web apps, data engineering, headless content management systems, regenerative living, and strength training. 

Currently working on a secure API to connect private and non-profit organizations that will help reduce homelessness in Washington state.
